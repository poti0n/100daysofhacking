### Day 15 + 16
Hackathon over the weekend with friends, worked on understanding fault injection

### Day 17
Fell off the wagon for 3 days, no work done

Day 17 starting 3 days after day 16:
Starting a hardware design course to learn more about FPGAs and hardware

### Day 18 + 19
More hardware design course

### Day 20
Over the wire natas 0-5

### Day 21
Over the wire natas 6-10: Learned about LFI vulnerabilities and touched PHP code for the first time

### Day 22
Didn't spend as much time on this as I did the last couple days, but attempted natas 11. There is quite a large difficulty spike for me with this level as I started to attempt it yesterday as well.

### Day 23
I finished natas 11!!!

### Day 24
Low energy today, but working on natas 12. From reading the code I know I have to try to exploit a RFI vulnerability and will attempt it tomorrow.

### Day 25
Finished natas 12, started 13

### Day 26
Natas 13

### Day 27
Natas 14 and 15. I really enjoyed these ones and learning about SQL injection, especially the moment my script for 15 worked!

### Day 28
Natas 16 and wrote the script for 17 but can't figure out what's wrong with it yet

### Day 29
Natas 17

### Day 30
Worked on natas 18

### Day 31
Pretty sick, will update this day again tomorrow with progress
...
Pivoted to advent of code, I'm trying to use it to learn C as I kinda skipped that and really need to just bite the bullet, holy crap I am having a BAD TIME with it so far.
Completed AOC day 1, I hope to catch up on the weekend and also do advent of cyber

### Day 32
Advent of code 2

### Day 33
Advent of code 3 part 1

### Day 34 
I think part 2 would best be solved with a linked list so I can "delete" elements and I could just copy implementations I've seen while trying to learn about them but I feel my time learning C would be better spent actually learning important things like wrapping my head around using pointers. So, this part will get done when it gets done

### Day 35
Learned about xsstrike

### Day 36
I'm back again, advent of cyber 1-4 done

### Day 37
Advent of cyber 5-6

### Day 38
Advent of cyber 7

### Day 39
Advent of cyber 8-10

### Day 40
A couple flags done on hackerone's ctf

### Day 41 + 42
Forgot to update yesterday but I continued and got 1 flag yesterday and another one today

### Day 43
Advent of cyber 11, took forever with technical issues on my end. Done yesterday, forgot to update again!!

### Day 44
Advent of cyber 12-17

### Day 45
Advent of cyber 18-22 and 5 flags from hacker101 ctf "postbook"

### Day 46
Advent of cyber 23, the 2 remaining postbook flags, and 2 flags from hacker101 ctf "cody's blog"

### Day 47
After some infuriating connection issues I was able to finish advent of cyber 24

### Day 48
I finished advent of cyber Christmas day but I think my browser is blocking the certificate download and can't be bothered to fix it right now, will add later. Today I got the last flag from cody's blog and the first flag from micro-cms v2

### Day 49
The last 2 flags of micro-cms v2

### Day 50
Well... what a halfway point. I got my covid booster Dec 29 and have been so under the weather. I attempted to do some hacker101 ctf the other day and came out unsuccessful due to the brain fog. I am counting that as day 50 and will update tonight for day 51. Still not feeling 100% but let's see what happens.

### Day 51
I have returned, I have sterted The XSS Rat's ethical hacking guide a-z course. As of last night I have gotten to *00x02 Networking Fundamentals*

### Day 52
Finished Networking Fundamentals

### Day 53
Started *00x03 Tools*, made it past the quiz and there is still a little more to do in this section

### Day 54
Finished Tools

### Day 55
*00x04 Passive Information Gathering*

### Day 56
Started *00x05 Getting A Foothold*

### Day 57
Continued working through *00x05*, I wanted to finish it today but had an emergency requiring a trip to the ER. I got a few videos done though.

### Day 58
Missed a day and forgot to update yesterday, oops. I finished *00x05 Getting A Foothold* yesterday.

### Day 59
Yesterday I played around with some google dorks on a bounty target

### Day 60
I forgot to update before I went to sleep a couple days ago, then missed a day. 2 days ago I set up the WSL2 on my terrible laptop to work with an X server on my linux box because I wanted to use it to run GUI applications, not only harness its power with SSH like I already was. Super cool. For the last 40 days I pledge to not miss a day.

### Day 61
Started and nearly finished *00x06 Privilege Escalation* just have the assignment left

### Day 62
Finished *00x06*

### Day 63
Finished *00x07 Buffer Overflow*

### Day 64
Started the Burp Suite section of the course

### Day 65
Haven't been enjoying the shallow tutorial-style course lately so I am starting to learn architecture with the book *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*. I got to section 1.4.2 today

### Day 66
Crappy day but I got to section 1.7

### Day 67
Read to 1.8

### Day 68
1.8 and part of 1.9 done. Sidenote I'm really enjoying this

A little trouble focussing today, read to 2.1

### Day 70
Read part of 2.1 and also collaborated on some pico ctf flags

### Day 71
More 2.1

### Day 72
More of 2.1, I think I need to learn more C before I continue with this book. I will start that tomorrow

### Day 73

### Day 74
More C book

### Day 75
Embedded systems course - 2 chapters

### Day 76

### Day 77
Forgot to update last night. Just more C book. I think my code reading is improving now

### Day 78
More C book, would like to do some of the practice problems tomorrow

### Day 79 + 80
Whoops, forgot to update yesterday. Yesterday I did one of the practice problems and more reading the C book. I was super proud even though it was a simple script because it was the first time I've fully understood how every piece of it works down to the hardware. Today I just did some reading, it's Saturday!
