### Day 15 + 16
Hackathon over the weekend with friends, worked on understanding fault injection

### Day 17
Fell off the wagon for 3 days, no work done

Day 17 starting 3 days after day 16:
Starting a hardware design course to learn more about FPGAs and hardware

### Day 18 + 19
More hardware design course

### Day 20
Over the wire natas 0-5

### Day 21
Over the wire natas 6-10: Learned about LFI vulnerabilities and touched PHP code for the first time

### Day 22
Didn't spend as much time on this as I did the last couple days, but attempted natas 11. There is quite a large difficulty spike for me with this level as I started to attempt it yesterday as well.

### Day 23
I finished natas 11!!!

### Day 24
Low energy today, but working on natas 12. From reading the code I know I have to try to exploit a RFI vulnerability and will attempt it tomorrow.

### Day 25
Finished natas 12, started 13

### Day 26
Natas 13

### Day 27
Natas 14 and 15. I really enjoyed these ones and learning about SQL injection, especially the moment my script for 15 worked!

### Day 28
Natas 16 and wrote the script for 17 but can't figure out what's wrong with it yet

### Day 29
Natas 17

### Day 30
Worked on natas 18

### Day 31
Pretty sick, will update this day again tomorrow with progress
...
Pivoted to advent of code, I'm trying to use it to learn C as I kinda skipped that and really need to just bite the bullet, holy crap I am having a BAD TIME with it so far.
Completed AOC day 1, I hope to catch up on the weekend and also do advent of cyber

### Day 32
Advent of code 2

### Day 33
Advent of code 3 part 1

### Day 34 
I think part 2 would best be solved with a linked list so I can "delete" elements and I could just copy implementations I've seen while trying to learn about them but I feel my time learning C would be better spent actually learning important things like wrapping my head around using pointers. So, this part will get done when it gets done

### Day 35
Learned about xsstrike

### Day 36
I'm back again, advent of cyber 1-4 done

### Day 37
Advent of cyber 5-6

### Day 38
Advent of cyber 7

### Day 39
Advent of cyber 8-10
